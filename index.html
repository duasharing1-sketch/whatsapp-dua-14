This powerful dua asks Allah ﷻ — by His divine wisdom and mercy — to anchor your heart and soul in the blessings He has made lawful. It seeks true happiness and satisfaction through what is Halal: from pure sustenance and provision to righteous companionship and intimate love, guarding you against the deceptive pull of forbidden desires and fleeting false pleasures.

Because lasting contentment comes only from embracing what pleases Allah and protecting yourself from what leads to harm or spiritual restlessness.

As Allah ﷻ says in the Noble Qur’an:

"Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer — We will surely cause him to live a good life..." Qur’an 16:97

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Hadi (O Guide), Ya Muhaymin (O Guardian), Ya Aziz (O Almighty), grant us true happiness and satisfaction through that which You have made Halal (permissible) for us. Protect us from the whispers of Shaytan (satan) and the pull of our Nafs (lower self) that may lead us to seek false happiness and satisfaction in that which You have made Haram (forbidden) for us. Strengthen our hearts in contentment in what is lawful, and make it a source of tranquility, love, and fulfillment. Let our desires be guided by Your divine wisdom and mercy.*
